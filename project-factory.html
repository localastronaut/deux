                            the idea to start a factory. The main goal would be to work on designing and building projects that would have a positive impact on the world. We started with concepts to better diagnose people when they were sick, check insurance
                            formularies, and calculate prescription dosing. Then we expanded to more sustainability projects. I built a collaboration platform that similar to the one used at Red Bull where I could invite my friends to collaborate on different
                            ideas. This site is originally where the concept for PerDiem was born. </p>

                            I would post different ideas and friends would leave feedback on them. We hosted all of our projects on it and used it as our main source of online communication. It was essentially a “collective intelligence” platform for ideas. I would take this feedback
                            and use the physical factory to bring them to life. We built a design studio that had all of the tools to build anything we could imagine. It was a creative space that inspired new ideas to come to life. </p>

                            I started moving outside of the digital design space and working on more physical systems. One of the first was designing a system to filter and recycle contaminated water for developing areas. I build a solar powered reverse osmosis recycling system.
                            It wasn’t the most beautiful system at first, but it worked great. I was asked to give a TEDx talk in Atlanta on it. </p>

                        I also designed and built all of the furniture in the Factory. I was able to take concepts learned in designing a coffee table and apply them to designing a website. Learning that it not only has to look good, but it has to be functional as well. That
                        every piece forms a whole to create one cohesive element. Even the smallest error would be prominently noticed by everyone. It was something that I couldn’t conceptualize until I saw it from a new perspective.

                        Around the same time I left Red Bull, my two closest colleagues left as well. The one who was in charge of building the global collaborations platforms left and started working at an agency to build them for other companies. Brands like Adidas would pay
                        over $2 million for one of these sites. My other friend (who was my boss) left for another company to build out a field marketing program similar to that at Red Bull. He needed to build one of these sites but didn’t have the budget
                        for my other friends agency. He asked if I could make something similar and I told him I could make something even better. </p>

                                So I tasked myself with designing a collective intelligence site that companies could use to collaborate. This was much different than messaging platforms like slack. It needed to be more creative, flexible, and customized for the companies specific goals.
                                I not only had an immense amount of experience working on the platforms at Red Bull and Red Bull Records, but I had just built one for The Factory and also designed one for PerDiem. Most of the work was already done, it
                                was just making a few adjustments to fit their specific needs. </p>
