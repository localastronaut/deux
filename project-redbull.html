                        <p class="pixies_dropcaps pixies_text"><b>W</b> Within my first few months working at Red Bull I was invited to the cabal to collaborate with HQ on special projects they had in the works. One of these projects what a global collaboration tool for all field reps to use
                            for communication and analytics. I was tasked with researching the most effective tools for the site and what features would be essential. After several months of iterations, the new site was ready for testing. I discovered
                            many challenges when designing a global system. Language barriers were a huge problem, and each region had different metrics for success. While the experience of the site was amazing, it started developing major problems as
                            it began to scale.

                            As I began working in the music world, my friend at HQ who had built the web platform I worked on had something new in the works. This one was much bigger. He was building a full global collaboration platform for all Red Bull Employees, not just the field
                            reps. He had some of the best engineers in the world working on it and several million dollars in budget. He asked if I would help and I was ecstatic.

                            The new music project I was working on began to have some success so we decided to use it to develop a best practice for the site. I worked on developing a format that each department could host itâ€™s information and it could be consistent and accessible
                            across all regions around the world. After many reiterations, we finally came to a design that worked. The site launched, and it was a huge success.

                        My design work caught the attention of some of the regional teams so they began tasking me with some graphic design projects. One day I was driving through downtown Atlanta and saw one of my designs being used on a prominent billboard promoting an upcoming
                        event. That was pretty cool.

                        Most of my work was creating non-traditional marketing campaigns. I would throw parties and events around the area to promote the brand. This required designing flyers, promoting, and recapping the events. I worked on a good amount of projects and we
                        started to have a decent amount of success in the area.
