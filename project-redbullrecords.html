                            My previous design work came in handy when I was tasked to develop the Red Bull Records logo. It wasn’t entirely intentional, we hired a big firm out of NY and spend an insane amount (I heard it was around 100k) for them to create one. They didn’t like
                            it so the GM came over and asked if I could make a better one. I did… and they ended up using my design. It’s still the logo used today.

                            Some of my early work was designing assets for the Red Bull field reps to use in promoting the artists. The most successful thing I made was a notebook that all employees received. In it I had everything about the label and it’s artists. It was an easy
                            and effective way to get the info into their hands and have it top of mind at all times.

                        After a while we started growing pretty fast and couldn’t rely on the Red Bull field team anymore. I was tasked to develop our own national field marketing team. This meant that we would not only have to develop our own team, we would need to build our
                        own collaboration platform as well. I worked on developing a specific site that would be more focused on our initiatives.

                                When iOS apps started becoming popular, I was approached by the brand to develop a mobile game that included music. We decided to create a flying game similar to guitar hero for our own music. The game would be based around an event called “Red Bull Air
                                Race” and the user would fly a plane though the course and the different stems of the music would go in and out based on how well the scored. It was an awesome game and the first time I really got to dive in the the creative
                                side of development.
