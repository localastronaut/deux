                            they are sick and how great it would be to have an app that people could use to help understand what was wrong.

                            She started creating mockups for how it would work and I thought I could help out. I had worked on some projects in the music space that had cool ways for people to search for music. Rather than selecting from a drop down list sorted in alphabetical order,
                            they were more emotionally driven and exciting to use.

                            I threw together some ideas for a new UX that was much simpler and more engaging than all the other lame healthcare apps. I created a character that would represent what the symptoms were the user was experiencing.

                        Most people didnâ€™t necessarily need an animated version of their condition, but we found that people loved having the character. It gave the app an emotion. It was something they could relate to. People loved scrolling through the different symptoms and
                        seeing the guy change.

                        We launched it to the App Store and started working on more apps. The next one was to check if a drug was on your formulary. We also built a dosing tool for medications. For all of these projects I needed to create all of the UI elements from scratch.
                        It was my first time working with iOS and each button had to be custom built. I worked on icons, color pallets, and buttons. Once we put them all together it was a refreshing look to the traditionally boring healthcare design.
